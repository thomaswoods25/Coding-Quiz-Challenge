With the 4th project, I was able to create a successful coding quiz challenge containing my html, css design and javascript code. Again I have continued to learn and grow my HTML skill and trying to perfect it. My HTML elements are composed of different structures, positions and styles being the baseline to the password generator for the website. The CSS design for my website contains the wrapper for the coding quiz challenge, the button to work the password generator and the feedback + time of the finished project to coding quiz challenge being displayed. I reached out to my ASKBCS, TAs during my office hours, my intructor during class hours and my acaedmic advisors for help. This fourt project was a great opportunity to continously craft my visual studio coding projects.
